# ðŸ’« About Me:
As an ambitious and driven individual, I am currently studying to become a software developer through the Makers bootcamp. Being a history graduate, I bring a unique perspective and skillset to the field. I have already gained foundational experience working with Ruby, JAVA, HTML, and CSS, and have experience in data analysis. I am highly self-motivated and have a logical approach to problem-solving, which I believe will help me thrive in a dynamic and challenging environment. I am inquisitive by nature with a commitment to upskilling. What excites me most about technology is the potential to innovate and make a positive impact on the world.

- Any experience relevent to software development

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Makers Academy (start_date to end_date)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### SOAS (start_date to end_date)

- BA History
- 2:1

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Basketball, gym, traveling
